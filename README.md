## This repo is a work in progress-
### Using Web3.Storage and IPFS, easily create personalized web-pages with user defined hyperlinks(photos, article, recipe, social post). 

- Login to the app, add your links and create your own website link using IPFS. User is returned a CID and link. 
- Login to openlinks.io again to change the website anytime(users website link is updated with a new one).


## User Flow
- User logs-in (https://openlinks.io) 
- User uses UI to create a .html page
- HTML page is exported to IPFS
- User is returned IPFS Webpage address
- Users personal website is linked with IPFS gateway address
