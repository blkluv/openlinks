# OpenLinks.io

## Its kinda working! https://openlinks.io

## This repo is a work in progress- KNOWN BUGS BELOW!
- React UI gets a little buggy when adding hyperlinks(not a big issue, better react)
- Need to be more specific about required format for links (tell users to fix with "http://www.example.com")
- IPFS Files are not pinned by system! IPFS node needs to stay up for personal website to remain avaliable via IPFS and gateway(fix ASAP)

### Using IPFS and the IPFS public gateway, easily create personalized web-pages with user defined hyperlinks(photos, article, recipe, social post). 

- Login to the app, add your links and create your own website link using IPFS. User is returned a CID and link. 
- Login to openlinks.io again to change the website anytime(users website link is updated with a new one).

(I believe this projects now works on Chrome Browsers/ there was an issue with Chrome not allowing cross transport but I believe I fixed it with a SSL cert) Check back later

- User Loggs-In (https://openlinks.io) 
- User uses UI to create a .html page
- HTML page is exported to IPFS
- User is returned

- User creates IPFS website with info they want 
  
- PIN the website to IPFS using local IPFS node

- Users personal website is linked with either IPFS CID or IPFS gateway link (return users CID to users system)
