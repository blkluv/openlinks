# This document is for the notes and information related to the development of Openlinks. This is all Public.

## Development Enviroment

Command for version specific install of dependencies- This may not be needed because the modules are already within the app files- check to make sure

npm install auth0-js@9.13.4 auth0-lock@11.25.1 express@4.17.1 express-jwt@5.3.1 express-jwt-authz@1.0.0 jwks-rsa@1.3.0 npm-run-all@4.1.5 react-router-dom@5.2.0

After that then you need to set-up your routes within Auth0 to make sure the front-end works as intended with a dummy auth0 Login account- 

Configure Auth0

- Sign up for Auth0

- Create Auth0 App to point to our react Front-End
- Configure .env values to match Auth0

## Currently Working On- 

- IPNS updates
- UI updates







## IPNS Notes

Stop wasting time and just use W3.Names. Coming up with your own configuration will take too much time Noryev... Focus on that later when there is time for that....
