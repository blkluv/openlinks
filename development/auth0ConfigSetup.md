## Configure Auth0

- Sign up for Auth0

- Create Auth0 Application within the Auth0 Dashboard to point to our React Front-End. 

  1.  Click the button that says "new applicaiton".
  2.  Choose single-page app for your configuration
  3.  Within the application uri section, Set the Login URI to (x...........) and set the "Allowed Callback URL" too (x.........).

maybe add this all within its own document... 

- Configure .env values to match your Auth0 Account

When you create your Auth0 Tenant configuration, think of the tenant like a development enviorment. It must be unique, so pick your own name- 

Then you need to create a new Auth0 App. Choose single page app and then go straight to settings.
